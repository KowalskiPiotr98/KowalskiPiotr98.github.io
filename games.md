This is a list of games that I've played and liked enough to put them on a list on the Internet.
It is presented in a random order (mostly) and not split in any (un)helpful way on purpose.
If you want to read more about the list itself, see [this blog post](/2024/10/02/video-game-list/).

- NieR:Replicant v1.whateveridontcare and NieR:Automata

    Yoko Taro might be my favourite game director (or whoever he actually is), and the story of those games (as well as all the other media related to NieR) is simply amazing and worth exploring deeply. If you like action combat, you will also not be disappointed with those games.

- Persona 3: Reload, Persona 4: Golder, Persona 5: Royal

    This entire series is special to me for many reasons, even though turn-based combat is not really my thing (you'll soon see that this list doesn't care about that). If you only want to choose 1 game go for Persona 3 if you've already played some JRPGs before, or Persona 5 otherwise. I'm also a firm believer that the first 3 Persona games (that's Persona 1, Persona 2, and Persona 2 again) don't actually exist.

- The SciADV series

    This is an entire series of visual novels, containing such games like Steins;Gate or Chaos;Child. If you don't know what visual novels are... just pick up Chaos;Child and find out. Also, Steins;Gate was the reason I've spent about 2 years playing nothing but visual novels, so that might be worth something.

- Mainline Muv-Luv games

    This is another series of visual novels (so avoid if you hate reading). Note that not mainline titles are also good, but the main 3 games are just something else. Just be prepared for some... uhh... Japanese culture?

- SubaHibi

    Fair warning, this visual novel is **strongly** 18+, and requires... certain mindset to complete and "enjoy". Don't even read about this game if you're not prepared for an... experience... let's call it that. Fun fact: this game actually warned me that I should make sure it's legal to play it in my jurisdiction before downloading it, which was definitely the first (and last... so far) time this happened.

- 428 Shibuya Scramble

    This one is definitely something unique in the industry, as it's almost an interactive movie or something. Still a very good story, though.

- Tales of Berseria

    The only entry from the Tales series on this list. Unique story (wait, are we the bad guys?) that's really enjoyable to play, sadly somewhat brought down by a janky fighting system.

- The Legend of Heroes series

    This is the closest to what I could name my favourite series. Every game starting with the Liberl arc, all the way through the Daybreak 1 (the latest release at the time of writing) combined creates a very unique world that no other series has managed to get even close to. Fair warning: playing through all of those games could take a really long time (like an entire year if you're not in a hurry), and more games are coming, so if you want to test the waters, play Trails through Daybreak first and see if you like it. You **really** need to play all of those games to understand what's happening (and I've already done that twice...). This is also a turn-based RPG, which I'm not a fan of... but that didn't stop me.

- Horizon

    Both Zero Dawn and Forbidden West were really enjoyable games. Those are also the first games on this list not from Japan...

- Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana

    Back to Japan we go... this action RPG has a great story (it's from the people who made Legend of Heroes), but also an enjoyable fighting system. Other Ys games are also good, but since they don't share plot, and this game is definitely my favourite in the series, I've decided to put only this one here. At least that was the plan until I've played Ys X: Nordics, which was so good I couldn't resist making at least a note about it here.


The above was the list of my absolutely favourite games. What follows is a list of still good games, which for one reason or another didn't end up there.

- Higurashi

  Just to annoy people who wrongly thing that Umineko is better.

- Raging Loop

  An interesting visual novel, which I would actually recommend as a good introduction to the genre for people who never played any before.

- Scarlet Nexus

  Interesting action RPG. Not the most involved, but I certainly enjoyed it.

- Atelier Ryza 1-3

  Not sure why, but I haven't enjoyed other Atelier games as much as this, which is why I'm gonna put that one here.

- Bayonetta

  The plot is just along for the ride, but the combat is cool.

- Haven

  Incredibly chill game with a very satisfying movement system.

- Oxenfree 1 and 2

  Mostly 2, but you need to play 1 to understand what's happening, so there's that.

- Judgment series

  Like Yakuza, but different.
