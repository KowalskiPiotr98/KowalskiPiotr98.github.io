title: Create encrypted filesystem containers on Linux
---

If you want to create an encrypted filesystem container on Linux, but want to use only built-in commands instead of something like VeraCrypt, look [here](https://gist.github.com/KowalskiPiotr98/604f85f52e1ba897ca9f94ea2d470fe1) for a bunch of scripts allowing you to do so.

Yes, this is just a lazy redirect to my gist, but since it already exists there I'm not going to move it here.
