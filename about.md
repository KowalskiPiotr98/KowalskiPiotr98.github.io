Hi there!
Welcome to my blog!

I'm just a random programmer who enjoys spending too much of his free time fiddling around with "tech" in general.
As I do things, sometimes I might write about them on this here blog for you to read (and maybe enjoy?).

I have some experience working on web-apps in general, from design and code to deployment and maintenance.
I've spent most of my time developing in C# and go, with occasional sprinkling of JavaScript here and there, sometimes begrudgingly hacking away with Python or Java.
Apart from that, I sometimes tinker with networking, hosting, and servers of various types.
I can use Linux to a reasonable degree and am capable of exiting vim while also saving changes.
On the side I do (too much) gaming.

Apart from my professional career, I've been working on a side-project called [rinkudesu](https://www.github.com/rinkudesu) for some time.
If anything particularly groundbreaking ever comes out of it, you might even read about it here.

I don't really have a public (private as well lol) social media presence, so no links here.
You can look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/KowalskiPiotr98) profile, though.

Oh, and one more thing.
The topics covered on this blog will reflect this wide range of interests.
The posts will also be irregular and there might be long gaps between them.
Just so you know.
