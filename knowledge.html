# Knowledge of Nuggets

This section lists all small pieces of knowledge that I've decided to archive for future reference.
Those are not long posts as you might find on the main page, but you might find them useful in some cases.

<div class="posts">
  {% for post in site.knowledge %}
  <article class="post">
    <h1 class="post-title">
      <a href="{{ post.url | relative_url }}">
        {{ post.title }}
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="{{ post.date | date_to_xmlschema }}" class="post-date">{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</time>

  </article>
  {% endfor %}
</div>
